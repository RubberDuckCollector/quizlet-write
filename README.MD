### hello world

## 2023-02-20
- completed development of first revision
- if there are vocab files that are empty, that is known

## 2023-02-21
- starting development of more command line arguments (--randomise)


# todo
- add a command line argument to randomise the cards
- add a command line argument to reverse the terms
- if the user wants both, it shouldn't matter as they'd be randomised anyway, the keys and values just can't be randomly switched
