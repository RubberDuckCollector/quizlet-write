# Quizlet write my version
- Find the flash cards that work with this program here: https://github.com/RubberDuckCollector/subject-resources
- note: i recommend using this for german vocab where the plural conjugation is in brackets
- e.g: the recipe - das Rezept *(-e)*

### technical explanation coming soon!

## 2023-02-20
- completed development of first revision
- if there are vocab files that are empty, that is known

## 2023-02-21
- starting development of more command line arguments (--randomise)

## 2023-02-22
- implemented command line arguments

## next features
- in easy mode and normal mode, the contents of all brackets will be shown in the hint

## future plans
- the program should tell the user how many cards they have left, the number of correct cards, and the number of incorrect cards
- all content within () brackets is preserved when a hint is constructed, while still obeying the rules of each difficulty (i.e easy mode still shows first 3 chars, normal: 1, hard: 0, very hard: "No hints!")
- statistics and tracking

## lesson of the day
- if you want to combine function arguments with string parsing, don't rely on chatgpt at all
