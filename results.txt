Round 1:
✓ What is a primary key?                                                            A unique field in a table
✓ What is a composite key?                                                          Two or more fields that are unique when combined
✓ What is the goal of normalisation?                                                To improve the efficiency of database queries, to remove repeating records and data
✓ First normal form (1NF) [1]: requirements for 1NF                                 All field names should be unique.
✓ First normal form (1NF) [2]: requirements for 1NF                                 Values in fields should be from the same domain and fields should be atomic.
✓ First normal form (1NF) [3]: requirements for 1NF                                 No two records can be identical.
✓ First normal form (1NF) [4]: requirements for 1NF                                 Each table needs a primary key.
✓ Second normal form (2NF) [1]                                                      Ensure the data is in 1NF and remove any partial dependencies.
✓ Second normal form (2NF) [2]                                                      Split tables with dual purposes into multiple tables and establish relationships between them.
✓ Second normal form (2NF) [3]                                                      Fix any many-to-many relationships created as a result of splitting tables.
✓ When to confidently split a table [1]                                             If a field or group of fields can be inferred from a field that is not the whole primary key.
✓ Second normal form (2NF) [4]                                                      Fix a many-to-many relationship by creating a linking table.
