What is a primary key?|A unique field in a table
What is a composite key?|Two or more fields that are unique when combined
What is the goal of normalisation?|To improve the efficiency of database queries, to remove repeating records and data
First normal form (1NF) [1]: requirements for 1NF|All field names should be unique.
First normal form (1NF) [2]: requirements for 1NF|Values in fields should be from the same domain and fields should be atomic.
First normal form (1NF) [3]: requirements for 1NF|No two records can be identical.
First normal form (1NF) [4]: requirements for 1NF|Each table needs a primary key.
Second normal form (2NF) [1]|Ensure the data is in 1NF and remove any partial dependencies.
Second normal form (2NF) [2]|Split tables with dual purposes into multiple tables and establish relationships between them.
Second normal form (2NF) [3]|Fix any many-to-many relationships created as a result of splitting tables.
When to confidently split a table [1]|If a field or group of fields can be inferred from a field that is not the whole primary key.
Second normal form (2NF) [4]|Fix a many-to-many relationship by creating a linking table.
Second normal form (2NF) [5]|The primary keys from the two initial tables are assigned as a composite key for the new linking table.
Second normal form (2NF) [6]|The many-to-many crow's feet relationships are flipped to become two one-to-many relationships joined by the new table.
Second normal form (2NF) [7]|The linking table allows one thing to be a part of many things.
Second normal form (2NF) [8]|A name in the linking table is not unique, but the combination of name and ID number is unique.
Second normal form (2NF) [9]|This normalisation solves issues such as repeating data and large composite keys.
Third normal form (3NF) [1]|Remove any transitive dependencies or non-key dependencies.
Third normal form (3NF) [2]: What is a non-key dependency?|A non-key dependency is when the value of a field is determined by the value of another field that isn't the primary key.
Third normal form (3NF) [3]: what do the fields say in court?|All fields should be dependent on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.
Third normal form (3NF) [4]|A table is already in third normal form if all fields are dependent on the primary key.
Third normal form (3NF) [5]: how would the linking table be in third normal form?|If has a composite key.
Third normal form (3NF) [7]: how can this be solved|Split the data into separate tables, creating a one-to-many relationship
Third normal form (3NF) [6]: how would a non-key dependnecy arise?|If information in a table can be inferred from other attributes
