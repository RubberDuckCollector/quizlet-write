# Top Priority TODO

- [ ] add a parity function to sync() that looks at sessions without a `session.json` file and retroactively creates it
    - [ ] add a function to sync() that corrects terms and sessions done on each day in `lifetime_stats.json["cards_per_day"]` and the same for sessions per day
        - need to get all session dir names, get all the text after the word "to" and parse that as a datetime object then go to each session.txt file for the specific day in question and count ONLY the ticks in each session.txt file and then overwrite the new figure in lifetime_stats.json
- [ ] make an optional command line argument that outputs the average and total number of sessions/flash cards done between 2 dates
- [ ] add a `--verbose` flag that prints to the user when each external module is loading when the program is executed
- [ ] make an automatic backup feature (basically duplicate all user data in a backup directory)
    - [ ] make the user able to restore from backup or manually overwrite backup
- [wip] break up `main.py` into many smaller files containing their own procedures
    - maybe separate ones for the hint system, the quiz, and others
- [ ] pretty print a flash card file
- [ ] implement a feature that allows the user to exit and save a session and resume a session
    - need to save `card_set` dict and the index of the current flash card
    - need to save the stats when the session is exited
    - need to save the time the session was started at
    - implement `--resume` command line argument that prompts an interactive selection mode for the saved sessions
    - need to take `start_time` as a parameter to `quiz()` if start time can be set arbritrarily by resuming a session
- [ ] compile the program to be shipped
- [ ] implement quizlet's bars that fill up and deplete as in the write mode according to the user's progress
    - [ ] for the progress through the quiz, make a progress bar
        - increment the bar when the progress is divisible by a certain number, which corresponds to a pre-mapped version of the progress bar
        - store the progress bar stages in a separate file and import them in `main.py`
- [wip] somewhat complete 2025-07-11: make a sync function that goes through all files in `records/` and counts how many ticks and crosses there are in each file, then overwrites those figures as the `lifetime_correct` and `lifetime_incorrect` stats in `lifetime_stats.json`
- [x] complete 2025-11-20: remove common data between `session.json` and `session.txt` and print out `session.json` instead of having duplicate data
- [x] complete 2025-11-20: hard difficulty but the `_` are replaced by spaces
- [x] complete 2025-07-15: migrate to x.isalpha() (works for different alphabets) instead of a list of chars to ignore
- [x] complete 2025-07-15: make it so normal/easy hints show the first 1/3 letters (that is, return True from .isalpha()) as well as any non-alpha character, not just the old behaviour of showing the first 1/3 chars no matter what and possibly wasting the hint chars
    - maybe use counters but not decrement the counters when there's a non-alpha char
        - figure out when to put the counter check in the if statement branches
- [x] complete 2025-07-11: put the end of session data into a `session.json` file
- [x] complete 2025-07-11: added `--sync` optional argument that reads data from `stats/records` and overwrites `stats/lifetime_stats.json` with the data collected
- [x] complete 2025-07-10: implement an optional command line argument where the program switches the position of the term and answer on each line of a flash card file, creates a "{filename}_OUTPUT.txt" file
- [x] complete 2025-07-09: add lifetime session correct and lifetime session incorrect counters to the program that get printed out at the end of the session
- [x] make it so the key in the PDF graph is shown to the left of the plot instead of the right
    - reasoning: we read english graphs from left to right so all sessions start on the left, all session plots are on the left so they key should be there too for better readability

## Next features/TODO

- [ ] use a proper logging system with a logging library
- [ ] optional command line argument that turns user input (except spaces) into * characters as they type
- [ ] make an automatic backup feature (basically duplicate all user data in a backup directory)- [ ] make the colours on the bar charts pretty
- [ ] a new command line argument where i use regex to highlight numbers and all 3 types of opening/closing brackets in a special colour
- [ ] implement a feature where at the end of a session, ask the user if they want to save the cards they got incorrect on the first round to a new file
    - file called `"{filename} {session_end_date_and_time} incorrect.txt"`
    - REQUIREMENTS: would need to make every session inside `stats/records` its own directory containing the record file and the graph
    - accuracy on the y axis, words done on the x axis
    - could do x axis as "cards remaining" and count down, or as "cards completed" and count up
    - could also do x axis as "% cards completed" or "% cards remaining"
    - this would be a measure of consistency
- [ ] implement a feature where the time taken to complete the quiz is written to the record file
- [ ] implement a feature where the command line arguments accept multiple files like this: `/file /file /file -difficulty -rand -flip`
    - files are appended to each other for the test (hold file paths in a list?)
    - maybe make the program run a bash script, integrating the `less` command or something idk
- [ ] add a fast mode where time.sleep() doesn't activate and the last term the user answered is displayed at the top of the screen as correct/incorrect
- [ ] add feature that puts the start and end date/times in the results file
- [ ] port the app to the blessed library and make it a fully featured TUI app
- [ ] turn it into a spaced repitition software
- [wip] implement a `-help` command line argument
    - can now calculate the average length of a flash card set/average time taken on a given day knowing the total number of cards studied and the total number sessions studied
    - implement it as a command line argument taken at the first position
- [x] complete 2025-07-11: put the data stored at the bottom of the session `txt` file in a separate file as JSON
- [x] mirgrate to argparse
- [x] streak feature (100% = perfect streak)
- [x] records system where the program dumps the contents of `results.txt` into a new file with the current date and time accurate to the second into a records dir
- [x] statistics and tracking - daily word count of cards done
- [x] expand --rand functionality to randomize at the end of each round, instead of only at the start of the session
- [x] tell the user the previous cards done today and the new cards done today
- [x] 2024-08-31: implement a feature that allows the user to have more than one session open at a time 
    - 11-10-2024: (this is done by having separate files tracking the progress of each session, no two files would conceivably be of the same session because the name is decided by time up to 6 digits on the second)
- [x] implement a feature that tracks every session's % correct and generates a line graph of the session
- [x] implement a feature where the command line arguments that are passed into the quiz are also written to the record file
- [x] add a stats tracker for the number of sessions finished in that day, not just the already established cards studied per day
- [x] implement a feature where the program ignores lines starting with a # in the flash card file. this allows me to put metadata in the flash card file and print it out when the session starts.
- [x] remove the 0/0 on the graph (2024-11-01)
- [x] might not be recording accuracy at 100% completion of the round PLEASE FIX (2024-11-01)
- [x] implement a feature where each round on the line graph has a different coloured line (2024-11-01)
- [x] write the path to flash cards on the graph title
- [x] make 2 txt files each for the data used to plot the x and y axis, saved under that session's particular dir
- [x] make the graph generated gradute in 1s instead of 5s (have to make the graph taller to do so)
- [x] add signals that tell the user the program is loading/importing libraries/when the program is first run and there's a big loading time, this would let the user that nothing's going wrong
    - maybe with a ... that increments
- [x] implement a feature that creates bar charts of how many sessions completed with each command line argument (e.g how many sessions with `-rand-once`/`-rand-every-round`/`-no-rand`? how many sessions with `-flip`/`-no-flip`? how many sessions with each difficuly?)
- [x] implement a feature that creates a bar chart with cards done on each day (Y axis) and date (X axis). days with 0 cards do not take up a space on the bar chart (maybe add an option to show all days regardless?)
- [x] make it so a string such as `test/test` renders as `t___/t___` on normal mode and `tes_/tes_` on easy mode instead of `t___/____`
- [x] sort out build log on github
- [x] ***make it so the graph only saves the relevant segment of the graph***
    - [x] make it so the saved graph adjusts to the relevant y axis coordinates that are saved
- [x] make it so the session and cards bar charts have a minimum size to accommodoate for bar charts with little data
- [x] fix warning that generates if the lower and greater values for the y axis are the same
- [x] implement a --test keyword that prevents stats from being saved but still allows the program to function normally otherwise
